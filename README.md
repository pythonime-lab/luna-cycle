# Her Cycle Keeper — Private Period & Cycle Tracker

> **AES-256-GCM encrypted. Zero data collection. Forever free.**

Her Cycle Keeper is a privacy-first period and cycle tracking PWA (Progressive Web App). All data is encrypted locally on your device using AES-256-GCM. **Nothing is sent to any server. No accounts. No analytics. No tracking.**

## Features

- 🔒 **End-to-End Encrypted** — AES-256-GCM encryption with your personal PIN
- 📱 **Progressive Web App** — Install like a native app on any device
- 🔴 **Period Tracking** — Log flow, symptoms, mood, and notes
- 📊 **Cycle Predictions** — Estimates fertile window, ovulation, and next period
- ⏰ **Notifications** — Get reminders before your period starts
- 📈 **Cycle Statistics** — View your cycle history and patterns
- 🚫 **Completely Offline** — Works without internet connection
- 💾 **Encrypted Backup** — Export and restore your data with your PIN

## How It Works

Cycle Keeper uses the **Calendar Rhythm Method** and **Standard Days Method** to estimate:

- **Fertile Window** — Days 8 through (cycle length − 11)
- **Ovulation Day** — Approximately (cycle length − 14) days from period start
- **Next Period** — Predicted based on your cycle length

**⚠️ Important:** Cycle Keeper is an educational tool only. It is **not** medical advice and must not be used as a contraceptive or fertility guarantee. Always consult a healthcare professional for medical decisions.

## Privacy & Security

- **No Servers** — No cloud storage, no accounts, no syncing across devices
- **No Analytics** — No tracking, no telemetry, no third-party code
